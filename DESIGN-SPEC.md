# **UI/UX Design Specification: Aura API Client MVP**

## **Part 1: The Aura Design System: Foundations in Material 3**

This section establishes the fundamental visual and interactive language of the application, codenamed "Aura." The design system is based on Google's Material 3, ensuring a modern, accessible, and consistent experience that is native to the Flutter ecosystem and can adapt to any platform.1 This foundation is critical for building a user interface that is not only aesthetically pleasing but also intuitive and scalable to accommodate the full feature set outlined in the strategic blueprint.3

### **1.1 Color Theory and Theming**

The application's color system must be robust, visually appealing, and support both light and dark modes to reduce eye strain and cater to user preferences. The core principle is to use a seed-color-based system, as recommended by Material 3, to generate full, harmonious color palettes programmatically.4 This approach ensures brand consistency and visual appeal while minimizing the effort of manual color selection.  
The implementation will begin with the selection of a primary brand color. For this specification, a vibrant purple (e.g., Color(0xFF6750A4)) is proposed as the seed color. Using Flutter's built-in ColorScheme.fromSeed() utility, this single color will generate the complete ColorScheme for both Brightness.light and Brightness.dark. This includes all necessary roles: primary, secondary, tertiary, surface, background, and error colors, providing a comprehensive and cohesive palette out of the box.4  
A critical component of an API client is the display of code and data. Therefore, two distinct syntax highlighting themes must be definedâ€”one for the light mode UI and one for the dark mode UI. These themes are essential for the code editor and response viewer components, ensuring high readability and quick differentiation of code elements. The themes will be based on popular, high-contrast editor schemes, such as a "Solarized Light" equivalent for light mode and a "Monokai" or "Dracula" equivalent for dark mode. The chosen themes must provide clear visual distinction for keywords, strings, numbers, comments, and other language tokens.6  
The decision to programmatically generate the color scheme from a single seed color is not merely an implementation detail; it is a strategic architectural choice. It aligns with the blueprint's goal of creating a professional, "Pro" tool.3 This architecture makes the application inherently "themeable" from its inception. A future feature could allow users to select their own seed color in the application's settings. This would enable a high degree of personalization and user delight with minimal additional engineering overhead, transforming color from a static design element into a dynamic user-facing feature.

### **1.2 Typography and Information Hierarchy**

A clear and consistent typographic scale is essential for guiding the user's attention, establishing a visual hierarchy, and ensuring readability across all platforms. The application will adopt the standard Material 3 type scale, which provides a well-researched set of text styles for different UI roles.4  
The font selection will be twofold. For all general UI text, a modern, highly legible sans-serif font like Google Fonts' "Roboto" or "Inter" will be used. For all instances of code, including the request body editor, response viewer, and scripting panes, a monospaced font with support for programming ligatures, such as "JetBrains Mono" or "Fira Code," will be designated. This separation ensures optimal readability for both prose and code.  
The Material 3 type styles (displayLarge, headlineMedium, titleSmall, bodyLarge, labelSmall, etc.) will be explicitly mapped to specific UI elements to enforce consistency.1 For instance:

* titleMedium will be used for the headers of major UI panes (e.g., "Collections," "Response").  
* bodyMedium will be the default style for most text content, such as descriptions and labels.  
* labelSmall will be used for less prominent text, like metadata or helper text.

This typographic system will be configured within the application's ThemeData in Flutter. By setting a custom textTheme, all default text widgets throughout the application will automatically inherit the correct styling, ensuring a consistent and polished look with minimal developer effort.

### **1.3 Iconography and Visual Language**

Icons are a critical part of the visual language, providing quick, scannable cues for actions and status. To maintain visual coherence, the application will use a single, comprehensive icon library.  
The exclusive icon set will be **Material Symbols**. This library is integrated with the Flutter framework and provides thousands of icons in various styles. The "rounded" or "sharp" style will be selected and used consistently throughout the application to establish a distinct visual identity.  
Icons will serve several purposes:

* **Actions**: IconButton widgets will use icons for common actions like save, send, add, folder, history, and settings.1  
* **Status Indicators**: Icons will provide immediate feedback, such as a green checkmark (check\_circle) for a 200 OK response or a red cross (error) for a failed request.  
* **Navigation**: Icons will be used in the NavigationRail and BottomNavigationBar to represent different sections of the app.5

To further enhance scannability, particularly in the request list (a key UI element in reference applications like Insomnia and Hoppscotch), each HTTP method will be assigned a distinct, high-contrast color. This allows developers to identify request types at a glance. The proposed color mapping is:

* **GET**: Green  
* **POST**: Blue  
* **PUT**: Orange  
* **PATCH**: Purple  
* **DELETE**: Red  
* **OPTIONS/HEAD**: Gray

This color-coding system, applied to the text label of the method (e.g., "GET") in the collections tree and request tabs, significantly improves the user's ability to parse complex collections quickly.

### **1.4 Spacing, Shape, and Elevation**

A consistent spatial system creates visual rhythm, reduces cognitive load, and brings clarity to the layout. The design will adhere to a base-8 spacing unit, a common practice in modern UI design. All padding, margins, and component dimensions will be defined in multiples of this unit (e.g., padding of 16dp, a standard button height of 48dp).  
The application will leverage Material 3's shape system to define corner radii for components, creating a soft, modern aesthetic. Different radii will be specified for small, medium, and large components, such as Buttons, Cards, and Dialogs, respectively.5  
Elevation will be used purposefully to denote interactivity and establish a clear visual hierarchy of layers. Instead of relying solely on traditional drop shadows, the design will use Material 3's surfaceTintColor concept. This subtly tints elevated surfaces with the primary color, creating a sophisticated sense of depth that is consistent with the overall color scheme. This effect will be most prominent on floating elements like Dialogs, Menus, and BottomSheets.4

## **Part 2: The Adaptive Shell: A Cross-Platform Layout Framework**

This section defines the high-level architectural structure of the application's user interface and the strategy for adapting it across a wide range of screen sizes and device types. This adaptive shell is the skeleton upon which all other components and features will be built, ensuring a robust and user-friendly experience on every platform.

### **2.1 Breakpoint and Layout Strategy**

The UI must be fluidly responsive, but simple scaling is insufficient for a professional tool. The design will employ a strategy of fundamentally refactoring the layout at key breakpoints to provide an experience optimized for each device class.8 This ensures that the application feels native and ergonomic, whether on a small mobile phone or a large desktop monitor.  
To implement this strategy, the responsive\_framework package is recommended.9 It provides a powerful and declarative way to manage breakpoints and control the responsive behavior of the UI.  
The primary breakpoints are defined as follows:

* **Mobile**: 0px \- 600px width  
* **Tablet**: 601px \- 1024px width  
* **Desktop**: 1025px width and above

A key aspect of the strategy is the distinction between "resizing" and "scaling".11 Resizing maintains the fixed pixel dimensions of certain elements (like a 56dp tall app bar), which looks appropriate on a phone but can appear disproportionately small on a large desktop screen. Scaling, on the other hand, maintains the aspect ratio of the entire UI, making it larger or smaller proportionally.  
For Aura, a hybrid approach provides the optimal user experience. On the **Mobile** breakpoint, the UI will *resize*. This respects platform conventions and ensures that interactive elements like buttons and text fields have a familiar, native feel. On the **Tablet** and **Desktop** breakpoints, the UI will *scale*. This makes better use of the available screen real estate, improves readability from a distance, and preserves the visual harmony of the layout on larger screens. The responsive\_framework package explicitly supports this hybrid configuration, allowing for a more nuanced and professional-feeling UI than a one-size-fits-all approach.9  
The following table provides an unambiguous specification for how the main UI panes should behave at each breakpoint. This eliminates guesswork for the development team and ensures the adaptive logic is implemented correctly.  
**Table 2.1: Responsive Layout Behavior**

| UI Pane | Mobile (0-600px) | Tablet (601-1024px) | Desktop (\>1025px) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Primary Sidebar (Collections/History)** | Hidden (Accessible via Drawer) | Visible (Collapsible) | Visible (Resizable) |
| **Main Content (Request/Response)** | Full Screen | Primary View | Primary View |
| **Contextual Panel (Environments/Tests)** | Hidden (Accessible via Tab/Modal) | Visible (Collapsible Right Panel) | Visible (Resizable Right Panel) |
| **Primary Navigation** | BottomNavigationBar | NavigationRail | NavigationRail |

### **2.2 The Core Layout Structure**

The UI is organized around the "Organizational Trinity" of Workspaces, Collections, and Environments, as defined in the strategic blueprint.3 The layout on larger screens is inspired by the three-pane structure common in developer tools and seen in the reference images \[Image 1, Image 5, Image 6\]. This structure consists of three primary, vertically resizable panes.

* **Primary Sidebar (Pane 1\)**: Located on the far left, this pane is the main organizational hub. It will contain a TabView or similar mechanism to allow users to switch between viewing their "API Collections" (presented in a hierarchical tree) and their "Request History."  
* **Main Content (Pane 2\)**: This is the central and largest area of the application, where the primary work of building and inspecting API calls occurs. It will house the Request Composer and the Response Viewer. To manage multiple open requests, this pane will use a tabbed interface, similar to modern IDEs and web browsers.  
* **Contextual Panel (Pane 3\)**: Located on the far right, this pane provides context-sensitive information and controls related to the currently active request in the Main Content pane. It will contain tabs for managing "Environments," editing "Scripts," and viewing "Test" configurations. On smaller screens, the functionality of this panel will be accessible through modals or tabs within the main content area.

### **2.3 Adaptive Navigation Patterns**

Navigation must be ergonomic and adhere to the established conventions of the target platform to be intuitive for users. The application's navigation will adapt significantly based on the active breakpoint.

* **Desktop/Tablet (\>600px)**: On larger screens, a NavigationRail will be the primary navigation control within the Primary Sidebar (Pane 1).1 This vertical navigation element is the standard Material 3 pattern for this form factor and is ideal for switching between top-level views like "Collections," "History," and "Settings".5  
* **Mobile (\<600px)**: On mobile devices, the multi-pane layout collapses into a single-view navigation model. A BottomNavigationBar becomes the primary method of navigation, a pattern universally understood by mobile users.1 It will feature persistent items for key tasks such as "Collections," "History," "New Request," and "Settings." Tapping an item will navigate the user to a dedicated full-screen view for that task.

## **Part 3: The Component Library: Atomic UI Elements**

This section provides detailed specifications for the key widgets that form the application's interface. Each component's design is linked to a recommended Flutter package to accelerate development and ensure high quality. A primary goal is to provide developers with a direct, unambiguous mapping from a required UI feature to a vetted package, reducing research time and ensuring architectural consistency.  
**Table 3.1: Core Component-to-Package Mapping**

| Component/Feature | Recommended Package | Pub.dev Link | Rationale/Key Features |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Collections Tree View** | flutter\_fancy\_tree\_view | [https://pub.dev/packages/flutter\_fancy\_tree\_view](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_fancy_tree_view) | Modern API, animations, lazy loading, and drag-and-drop support.12 |

### **3.1 The Collections Tree (Pane 1\)**

The ability to browse and organize API requests efficiently is fundamental to the user experience. The collections tree must be fast, intuitive, and support complex, nested hierarchies.

* **Package Selection**: The flutter\_fancy\_tree\_view package is recommended.12 While other tree view packages exist 15,  
  flutter\_fancy\_tree\_view is noted for its modern API, excellent performance with large datasets (due to sliver-based lazy rendering), smooth animations, and built-in support for drag-and-drop, which is crucial for reordering requests.  
* **UI/UX Specification**:  
  * Each node in the tree will be represented by a ListTile-like widget. It will display the colored HTTP method label (e.g., "GET"), the request name, and a trailing IconButton with a "more" icon (...) to open a context menu.  
  * Folders will be clearly distinguishable with a dedicated folder icon (e.g., folder).  
  * **Interactions**: The tree will support single-click to select a request (loading it into the main pane), double-click to open it in a new tab, and drag-and-drop to reorder requests and move them between folders. The expand/collapse action for folders will be accompanied by a smooth animation to provide clear visual feedback.12  
  * **Context Menu**: A right-click on desktop or a long-press on touch devices will open a Material 3 Menu.5 This menu will provide essential actions such as "New Request," "New Folder," "Rename," "Duplicate," and "Delete."

### **3.2 The Request Composer (Pane 2\)**

Composing an API request must be a clear, guided process that gracefully handles the complexity of different protocols and authentication methods. The design is based on the tabbed interface standard seen across all major competitors \[Image 5, Image 6\].

* **UI/UX Specification**:  
  * **Top Bar**: A Row widget will contain the three primary action elements: an HTTP Method DropdownButton (GET, POST, etc.), the main URL TextField, and a prominent "Send" FilledButton.1  
  * **Tabbed Interface**: Below the top bar, a TabBar will organize the various parts of the request 1:  
    * **Params**: A key-value editor for URL query parameters.  
    * **Authorization**: A dropdown to select the authentication type. For the MVP, this will include "No Auth," "Basic Auth," and "Bearer Token".3 The UI below the dropdown will dynamically change to show the required input fields (e.g., Username/Password for Basic Auth).  
    * **Headers**: A key-value editor for request headers, which will include autocompletion for common header names (e.g., Content-Type, Accept).  
    * **Body**: This tab will contain a sub-tabbed view to select the body type: none, form-data, x-www-form-urlencoded, or raw. Selecting the "raw" option will display the dedicated Code Editor widget for entering JSON, XML, or other text-based payloads.  
    * **Tests**: A full-featured Code Editor for writing post-request test scripts. As per the blueprint, this will use Dart as the scripting language.3

### **3.3 The Code Editor (for Body and Tests)**

The code editing experience is not an afterthought; it is a core feature for a developer tool. It must be on par with modern IDEs, offering syntax highlighting, code folding, and other essential developer-centric features.

* **Package Selection**: The flutter\_code\_editor package is the clear choice for this component.7 It is well-maintained, feature-rich, and built on top of the  
  highlight package. It provides out-of-the-box support for syntax highlighting across over 100 languages, code folding, theming, and hooks for custom autocompletion, making it far superior to more basic highlighting widgets.6  
* **Features**:  
  * **Syntax Highlighting**: The editor will be themed according to the light/dark mode themes defined in section 1.1. The language for highlighting will be determined automatically based on the request's Content-Type header (e.g., application/json will enable JSON highlighting) or can be selected manually by the user.  
  * **Code Folding**: Users will be able to collapse and expand JSON/XML objects, arrays, and code blocks, which is invaluable for navigating large payloads.7  
  * **Gutter and Line Numbers**: The editor will display line numbers and folding handles in the left-hand gutter, a standard convention for all code editors.  
  * **Future-Proof Architecture**: The package's architecture allows for future integration of advanced features like autocompletion based on imported OpenAPI schemas or live GraphQL introspection results.

### **3.4 The Response Viewer (Pane 2\)**

Inspecting API responses must be fast, efficient, and provide multiple ways to view and interpret the returned data.

* **UI/UX Specification**:  
  * **Status Bar**: Directly above the response content, a prominent status bar will display the most critical information at a glance: the HTTP Status Code and text (e.g., "200 OK" rendered in green), the round-trip time (e.g., "578 ms"), and the response size (e.g., "5.3 KB"). This is a standard and highly effective feature seen in all reference images \[Image 1, Image 2\].  
  * **Tabbed Interface**: A TabBar will allow the user to switch between different views of the response data:  
    * **Preview**: An intelligent view that attempts to render the response in the most useful way. It will render HTML content, display images directly, and for structured data like JSON or XML, it will use the Code Editor widget for pretty-printing, syntax highlighting, and folding.  
    * **Raw**: A simple text view showing the raw, unformatted response body.  
    * **Headers**: A read-only table displaying all response headers.  
    * **Cookies**: A table displaying any cookies set by the response.  
    * **Test Results**: A structured view showing the output from the post-request Dart test script. It will clearly list each assertion with a pass/fail status icon and any associated output or error messages.

### **3.5 Key-Value and Data Table Editors**

Entering tabular data, such as headers, query parameters, and form data, must be efficient and keyboard-friendly.

* **Package Selection**: For the simple key-value editors required by the MVP, a custom widget built from a ListView of Rows containing TextFields will be sufficient and performant. However, for displaying more complex, read-only data (like response headers or test results) and for future features requiring advanced data grids, the **Syncfusion Flutter DataGrid** is the recommended "Pro" solution.18 It offers high performance with large datasets, sorting, filtering, and extensive customization options, aligning perfectly with the product's strategic positioning. Flutter's built-in  
  DataTable is a fallback but has documented performance limitations with large datasets and should be avoided for core features.19  
* **UI/UX Specification**: The key-value editor will be a list of rows. Each row will contain TextFields for "Key" and "Value," an optional "Description" field, a Checkbox to easily enable or disable the row without deleting it, and an IconButton to delete the row. A button labeled "Add New" will be persistently available at the bottom of the list to append a new, empty row.

## **Part 4: Platform-Specific Design Specifications**

This section details how the established design system and component library are assembled into cohesive and optimized experiences on each of the target platforms. The goal is to leverage the shared codebase of Flutter while delivering an interface that feels intentional and ergonomic for each specific form factor.

### **4.1 Desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux) and Web: The Canonical Experience**

The desktop and web platforms represent the primary, full-featured experience for Aura. This is where developers will perform their most complex tasks, and the UI must be optimized for power and productivity.

* **Layout**: The full three-pane layout, as described in section 2.2 and specified in Table 2.1, is the default. All three panes (Primary Sidebar, Main Content, Contextual Panel) will be present and user-resizable via draggable dividers, allowing developers to customize their workspace.  
* **Interaction**: The experience is optimized for mouse and keyboard input.  
  * **Keyboard Shortcuts**: A comprehensive set of keyboard shortcuts is non-negotiable for a professional developer tool. These will be implemented for all common actions, including:  
    * Ctrl/Cmd \+ Enter: Send Request  
    * Ctrl/Cmd \+ S: Save Request  
    * Ctrl/Cmd \+ N: New Request  
    * Ctrl/Cmd \+ T: New Tab  
    * Ctrl/Cmd \+ W: Close Current Tab  
  * **Window Management**: The native desktop application will support multiple windows, allowing a user to work on different workspaces simultaneously.  
  * **Context Menus**: Right-click context menus will be used extensively throughout the applicationâ€”in the collections tree, on request tabs, and within text editorsâ€”to provide quick access to relevant actions.

### **4.2 Tablet: The Adaptive Bridge**

The tablet experience serves as a bridge between the dense desktop UI and the focused mobile UI. It must be flexible enough to function as both a consumption device and a lightweight creation tool.

* **Layout**: The layout will strictly follow the adaptive rules defined in Table 2.1. In landscape orientation, the UI will closely resemble the desktop layout, offering a powerful, multi-pane experience. In portrait orientation, screen real estate is more constrained. To adapt, the sidebars will collapse into icon-only rails or become slide-out drawers, maximizing the space available for the main content area.  
* **Interaction**: The UI is optimized for touch input. All tap targets (buttons, list items) will meet or exceed accessibility guidelines for size. Core interactions like drag-and-drop for reordering requests in the collections tree will be fully supported via touch gestures.

### **4.3 Mobile: A Task-Oriented Approach**

It is both impossible and undesirable to replicate the feature-dense desktop UI on a small mobile screen. Attempting to do so would result in a cluttered and unusable application. Instead, the mobile experience for Aura will be designed as a **task-oriented companion app**. It will prioritize quick access, consumption of information, and the execution of pre-defined actions over complex, from-scratch request creation.  
The competitive landscape shows a distinct lack of powerful, well-designed mobile companion apps for API clients, presenting a strategic opportunity.3 A developer on the go is less likely to need to build a complex gRPC request and more likely to need to quickly check a production endpoint's status after a monitoring alert, re-run a failing test, or share a request with a colleague. The mobile UI is designed specifically for these "jobs to be done."

* **Navigation**: A Material 3 BottomNavigationBar serves as the root of the mobile app, providing access to four key areas 1:  
  * **History**: A ListView of recently executed requests. Tapping an item opens a read-only summary of the request and response. A prominent "Re-run" button allows for one-tap execution.  
  * **Collections**: A read-only TreeView of all synced collections and requests. Tapping a request immediately executes it using its saved configuration and the currently active environment. This allows for rapid health checks and test execution from anywhere.  
  * **Scan**: A novel feature that uses the device camera to scan a QR code. This QR code can contain a full cURL command, which is then instantly parsed and imported as a new request in the user's scratchpad. This provides a powerful, fast way to import requests from a desktop screen or a colleague's device.  
  * **Settings**: Standard application settings, account information, and synchronization status.  
* **Request Creation**: A FloatingActionButton (FAB) provides the entry point for creating a new, one-off request.5 Tapping it opens a simplified, full-screen form containing only the most essential fields: URL input, method selector, and basic header/body text areas. This is intended for quick, simple tests, not for building complex, multi-stage workflows.

### **4.4 The Command-Line Interface (CLI): The Developer's Cockpit**

The CLI is a first-class citizen of the Aura ecosystem, not an afterthought. It is designed for both interactive human use and robust, scriptable automation, sharing its core business logic with the GUI applications for feature parity.3 The design will adhere to established conventions to ensure it feels fast, powerful, and intuitive to developers.20 It will be implemented as a pure Dart application, using the  
args package for powerful and reliable argument parsing.23

* **CLI Design Philosophy**:  
  * **Consistent Structure**: Commands will follow the logical and predictable aura \[noun\]\[verb\] pattern (e.g., aura collection run "My API Tests").22  
  * **Flags Over Arguments**: The CLI will strongly prefer named flags (e.g., \--environment "staging") over positional arguments. This makes commands self-documenting and removes the cognitive load of remembering argument order.20  
  * **Informative Feedback**: Long-running operations will provide visual feedback using spinners or progress bars to assure the user that the process has not stalled. Success and failure will be clearly and immediately indicated with color-coded output and icons (e.g., âœ” Success, âœ– Error).20  
  * **Helpful by Default**: Every command and subcommand will have a \--help flag that prints a clear description, usage syntax, and a list of all available options and flags. In interactive mode, if a required flag is missing, the CLI will prompt the user for the necessary input rather than failing immediately.20  
  * **Scriptable and Composable**: A global \--json flag will be available for all commands that produce output. When used, it will suppress all decorative output (colors, spinners, tables) and print results as structured JSON to stdout. All errors will be written to stderr and will be accompanied by a non-zero exit code. This design makes the CLI a well-behaved citizen in any automated environment, allowing for easy integration with CI/CD pipelines and shell tools like jq.21

The following table specifies the surface area for the MVP version of the CLI.  
**Table 4.1: CLI Command Structure (MVP)**

| Command | Arguments/Flags | Description | Example Usage |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| aura run \[request-or-collection\] | \--env \<name\>, \--json | Executes a saved request or all requests in a collection against a specified environment. | aura run "Login Request" \--env "production" |
| aura import \<file\> | \--format \<postman|curl\> | Imports data from an external file, such as a Postman collection or a file containing a cURL command. | aura import./postman\_collection.json |
| aura login |  | Interactively authenticates the CLI with the Aura cloud service to sync data. | aura login |
| aura whoami |  | Displays the currently authenticated user. | aura whoami |

## **Epilogue: Prototyping the GUI with HTML and CDN**

To facilitate rapid validation of the proposed desktop/web GUI layout and its responsive behavior, a lightweight, interactive mockup can be created using a single HTML file and CDN-hosted libraries. This approach allows stakeholders to experience the feel of the application's structure without the overhead of setting up and building the full Flutter application.

### **E.1 Framework Selection and Setup**

* **Framework**: **Beer CSS** is the recommended framework for this task.25 Its core design is based on Material Design 3, which provides a look and feel that is thematically consistent with the final Flutter application. Crucially, it is extremely lightweight, can be included via a CDN, and requires no build step or complex configuration, making it ideal for rapid prototyping. An even simpler alternative is  
  **Pico.css**, which offers a classless, semantic approach if that is preferred.25  
* **Setup**: Create a single HTML file named index.html. In the \<head\> section, include the Beer CSS stylesheet and its corresponding JavaScript module directly from a reliable CDN like jsDelivr. This is all the setup required.  
  HTML  
  \<\!DOCTYPE html\>  
  \<html lang="en"\>  
  \<head\>  
      \<meta charset="UTF-8"\>  
      \<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"\>  
      \<title\>Aura API Client \- Prototype\</title\>  
      \<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/beercss@3.5.1/dist/beercss.min.css"\>  
      \<script type="module" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/beercss@3.5.1/dist/beercss.min.js"\>\</script\>  
  \</head\>  
  \<body\>  
      \</body\>  
  \</html\>

### **E.2 Mockup Construction Guide**

* **Core Structure**: The three-pane layout will be constructed using semantic HTML tags (\<aside\>, \<main\>, \<nav\>) and styled with Beer CSS's layout and helper classes.  
  * The main application container will be a div or the \<body\> tag itself, configured with a flexbox layout (\<div class="contents"\>).  
  * **Pane 1 (Sidebar)**: An \<aside\> element will represent the primary sidebar. It will contain a mock tree structure built with nested \<ul\> and \<li\> elements to simulate the collections view.  
  * **Pane 2 (Main Content)**: A \<main\> element will occupy the central, flexible space. Beer CSS's tabs component can be used to mock the request/response tabbed interface. Placeholder content for the request composer can be built using Beer CSS field elements for inputs, and response data can be shown in \<pre\>\<code\> blocks.  
  * **Pane 3 (Contextual Panel)**: Another \<aside\> element will represent the right-hand panel for environments and tests.  
* **Component Mockups**: Use Beer CSS's pre-styled components to quickly build out the interface. Classes for button, input, card, and table will allow for a visually representative mockup of the Request Composer and Response Viewer with minimal custom CSS.25

### **E.3 Responsive Layout Guidelines**

The primary goal of the mockup is to demonstrate the adaptive layout strategy defined in Part 2\.

* **Implementation**: This will be achieved using Beer CSS's built-in responsive helper classes, such as hide-on-small, hide-on-medium-and-down, etc..25  
  * The HTML for the sidebars (\<aside\>) will be decorated with these classes to ensure they are hidden on smaller screen sizes, allowing the \<main\> content to expand and fill the screen.  
  * This directly simulates the behavior specified in Table 2.1. By simply resizing the browser window, stakeholders can interactively test and feel how the layout transitions between the mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints.  
  * For any fine-tuning that the framework's classes do not cover, a small number of custom CSS media queries can be added within an inline \<style\> tag in the document's \<head\>. This combination provides a tangible, interactive model for validating the core layout principles before a single line of Dart code is written.
