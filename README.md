# **Aura API Client: A Modern, Cross-Platform API Toolkit**

---

Aura is a modern API client built from the ground up with Dart and Flutter to provide a native, performant, and aesthetically pleasing experience across all platforms. In a market where tools have become increasingly complex and resource-intensive, Aura fills the "Developer Experience Gap" by delivering a tool that is finely tuned to the modern developer's workflow: fast, intuitive, and focused.1  
Whether you're on Windows, macOS, Linux, in a web browser, on your phone, or in the terminal, Aura provides a consistent and powerful toolkit for all your API development needs.

## **The Aura Advantage: Unifying the Testing Spectrum**

The modern API development workflow is fragmented. Developers use interactive GUI clients like Postman or Insomnia for building, debugging, and functional testing, but must then switch context to a completely different, command-line-driven tool like Artillery.io for performance and load testing.1 This context switch requires manually translating functional tests into scripted performance scenarios, creating friction and slowing down the development cycle.  
Aura's core mission is to eliminate this friction by **unifying the API testing spectrum**.  
With Aura, you can craft a request, add functional assertions, and then seamlessly "promote" that functional test into a full-scale performance test scenario using our integrated, **Artillery.io-compatible load testing engine**. This creates a powerful, cohesive workflow that does not exist in any other mainstream tool, representing a significant strategic advantage and a fundamental rethinking of the API development process.1

## **Core Features**

Aura is packed with the features you need to work efficiently with any API.
